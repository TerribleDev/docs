# Stoplight v4.1.0â€Šâ€”â€ŠFair Use Billing, Magic Links, Custom CSS, Landing Pages, Token Generation
The first major update to Stoplight Next is live! Weâ€™ve been hard at work building out a bunch of new exciting features based on all your invaluable feedback. Now letâ€™s dig in!

## New ðŸš€
- **[Fair Use Billing](https://docs.stoplight.io/platform/getting-started/billing)**: We instituted a fair use billing policy because we wanted our users to only pay for what they use. This means that you will only pay for the users actively contributing on your account in any given 30 day billing cycle. Unleash your Engineers!Â 
- **Annual Billing**: We enabled a year long billing option that helps you save up to 20%.Â 
- **[Magic Invite Links](https://docs.stoplight.io/platform/organizations/invite-people)**: Invite people to your Organization or Project simply by generating a link and sending it. Abra Kadabra.Â 
- **[Custom CSS](https://docs.stoplight.io/documentation/design/custom-css)**: Add some custom style and flair to your documentation with Custom CSS.Â 
- **Custom HTML Landing Pages**: Create beautiful custom landing pages to greet and direct your users.Â 
- **[OAuth2 Token Generation in Hubâ€™s Try it Out](https://docs.stoplight.io/documentation/oauth-hubs)**: If your API is protected by OAuth2, you can now generate tokens to enable Try it Out.Â 

## Enhancements ðŸ’ª
- **IE 11 Support for Published Hubs**: IE 11 now renders documentation created in Hubs.Â
