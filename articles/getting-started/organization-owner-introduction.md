## Welcome to Stoplight NEXT!

If you are trying to create a new Organization then you are in the right place. Stoplight NEXT was designed with large scale collaboration and governance as a central principle. The following guide will take you through the process of creating and populating an Organization, and offer an overview of the governance tools within Stoplight NEXT. 

## Organization 
Organizations function as a shared space for you and your co-workers. Members of an Organization have access to a centralized Activity Feed, Project Repository, and an Issues (link) discussion tool. Organization Owners can also assign varying levels of Permissions to other members of the Organization.  
 
* [Create an Organization](./create-org.md)
* [Invite People to Organization](./managing-people.md) 
* [Remove People from your Organization](./remove-people.md) 
* [Member Roles and Permissions](./roles.md)
* [Customize your Organization](./customize-org.md) 
* [Transfer Primary Ownership](./transferring-ownership.md) 
* [Delete an Organization](./delete-org.md)

## Teams 
If you are managing a large Organization with multiple teams you can use Teams to group Organization members together. 

* [Create a Team](./create-team.md)
* [Add People to a Team](./add-people.md)
* [Remove People from a Team](./remove-people.md)
* [Member Roles and Permissions](./member-roles.md) 
* [Customize a Team](./customize-team.md) 
* [Transfer Primary Ownership](./transfer-ownership.md) 
* [Delete a Team](./delete-team.md) 

## Projects 
Projects are the workspaces you can create for your Organization. 

* [Creating a Project](./create-project.md) 
* [Invite People & Teams to a Project](./invite-people-team.md)
* [Change a Project Memberâ€™s Role](./change-member-role.md)
