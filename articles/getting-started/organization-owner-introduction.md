## Welcome to Stoplight NEXT!

If you are trying to create a new Organization then you are in the right place. Stoplight NEXT was designed with large scale collaboration and governance as a central principle. The following guide will take you through the process of creating and populating an Organization, and offer an overview of the governance tools within Stoplight NEXT. 

## Organization 
Organizations function as a shared space for you and your co-workers. Members of an Organization have access to a centralized Activity Feed, Project Repository, and an Issues (link) discussion tool. Organization Owners can also assign varying levels of Permissions to other members of the Organization.
