![Download Static HTML and CSS](https://github.com/stoplightio/docs/blob/develop/assets/gifs/export-static-html.gif?raw=true)

> Requires a Pro Docs plan 

## What 
If you would rather host your documentation outside of Stoplight's hosted servers, you can download a built version of your Hub. Downloading a build will produce a `.zip` containing all of the minified assets necessary to load your Hub. These assets will include HTML, JAvascript, CSS, and JSON files. 

## How to Download
1. Click the **Publish** icon on the far left toolbar 
2. Select or create a **domain**
3. Choose a **Hub** or **OAS** file to create a build from 
4. Click the **Build** button to start the build process. 

> If this is your first build, it will also publish to your selected domain 

5. Once your **Hub** has finished building, it will appear in the **Builds** section. Click the download icon to the right of the build
