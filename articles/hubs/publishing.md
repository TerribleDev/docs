# Publishing 

## What 

Publishing your documentation has never been easier. Stoplight NEXT has added: 
- New **Integrations** for Segment, Intercom, and Google Analytics to allow for traffic monitoring and additional analytics 
- New **Authorizations** including Username/Password Logins, Auth0, and SAML for different levels of security like SSO
- New **Builds** section displays additional information and access to Live Builds

Take that Gutenberg!
