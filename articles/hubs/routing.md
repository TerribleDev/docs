## What 
Stoplight’s Hubs features an easy to use routing system to make sure your docs have identifiable and friendly URL’s. The routing system allows customization of the following objects: 

- Your Hub 
- Pages within a Hub (link) 
- Subpages within a Hub (link) 
- Headers + Footers (link)
- Links 


<!-- theme: info -->
>Friendly URLs are links that are easily readable, rememberable, and relevant to the content.
Take a look at the URL for this page. Instead of something like https://help.stoplight.io/docs/fnIenof/123, it is https://help.stoplight.io/docs/hosted-documentation/create-friendly-urls, which is much nicer. </>
