## What
Subpages are the second tier macro building blocks of Hubs. They function as a canvas for blocks. They are commonly used to house content based on a specific topic.  Subpages can have more subpages nested underneath them, which gives you lots of flexibility to organize your Hub as you see fit. If a subpage has subpages nested inside of it, it will be displayed as a collapsible group in the left sidebar.

>Subpages populate the navigational sidebar of a page.
