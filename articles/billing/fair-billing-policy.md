# Fair Billing Policy 

Stoplight's Fair Billing Policy means you will only be charged for active users in any given billing cycle. We adopted the Fair Billing Policy because we believe you should only pay for what you use. We also wanted to avoid setting strict user limits because it can lead to workflow bottlenecks and promotes poor engineering practices. 

## Active User 
To be considered an active user, you must perform on of the following actions: 
- Make a commit 
- Write or modify a file 
- Publish documentation 

> If you do not perform on of these actions durign a billing cycle, you will be considered inactive, and will not count towards your user count for that billing cycle.
