# Viewing Changes

As more users edit files within the same project, tracking changes over time
becomes more and more difficult. To help make sure changes can be easily tracked
and viewed, Stoplight provides the full history of changes.

To see the history of changes for a project, use the 'History' button on the
navigation bar to the left of the project window (show below). When the history
is being viewed, you will see a series of changes for the project, listed in
date descending order.

Each change event includes information, including:

* The date when the change was made

* The user who made the change

* The files updated by the change

* The differences (known as the 'diff') between each file before and after the
  change occurred

See the image below for an overview of the contents of the change view.
