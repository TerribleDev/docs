# Referencing another API Specification

<!-- REFBUILDER GIF/VIDEO-->

## What

Depending on your use case, you may find yourself needing to reference or connect to another spec or part of your current one.

This can be done easily for another specification in your project, one that has been publicly shared, one from an external source, or even reference certain targets within your current specification.

Reasons for referencing another specification include generating documentaion in hubs from an oas file, deduplicating common structures in modeling, testing a connected specification in scenarios, or setting up a mock server for an API.

## How

1.  Choose the appropriate data source.

    * This File

    * This Project


      * Shared/Common

      * External URL

2.  Select a file or enter a valid url that contains data for an existing specification.

3.  Select a target, if required or applicable.

4.  Confirm your choice, if you see a confirm button.

5.  View the referenced specification by clicking the book icon.
