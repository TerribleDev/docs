# Referencing another API Specification

<!-- ![image]() -->

## What

Depending on your use case, you may find yourself needing to reference or connect to another spec. You have the ability to easily connect to another specification in your project, one that has been publicly shared, one from an external source, and even reference certain targets within your current specification. You can reference either the entire specification or target a specific section if applicable. This can be used to generate documentaion in hubs, deduplicate common structures in modeling, test a connected specification in scenarios, or setting up a mock server for an API.

## How

* Choose the appropriate data source.

  * This File

  * This Project

    * Select a file.

  * Shared/Common

  * External URL

    * Enter a valid url that contains data for an existing specification.

* Select a target, if required or applicable.

* Confirm your choice, if you see a confirm button.

* View the referenced specification by clicking the book icon.
