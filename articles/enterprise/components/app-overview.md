# The Stoplight App

The __app__ component powers the Stoplight user interface by connecting users to the Stoplight API and other services.

> ### Requirements
> 
> #### Storage
> 
> There are no storage requirements for this component.
> 
> #### Networking
>
> The default port for the app component is TCP port __3100__. The port can be customized using the `PORT` environment variable.
> 
> _Be sure that both API and Gitlab components are available __before__ starting the app service_

## Installation

The Stoplight app can be installed with Docker or via RPM package.

> Before starting, be sure to complete the Gitlab and API installations.

### RPM Package

Prior to installing the RPM package, you will need to:

* Install NodeJS

* Have the Stoplight package repository installed and configured with your user-specific credentials

#### Installing NodeJS

To install NodeJS, please run the following commands:

```bash
# make sure all current versions of nodejs are removed
sudo yum remove nodejs npm -y

# install nodejs
sudo rpm -Uvh https://rpm.nodesource.com/pub_8.x/el/7/x86_64/nodejs-8.9.4-1nodesource.x86_64.rpm
```

Once the installation has completed, verify the version installed with the command:


```bash
$ node --version
v8.9.4
```

If you do not see a version starting `v8.9`, please contact Stoplight support for assistance.

#### Setting up the Package Repository

You can do this by copying-and-pasting the contents below into a terminal:

```bash
# expose credentials to environment first
REPO_USERNAME="myusername"
REPO_PASSWORD="mypassword"

# write credentials to repo file
cat <<EOF | sudo tee /etc/yum.repos.d/stoplight.repo
[stoplight]
name=Stoplight Package Repository
baseurl=https://$REPO_USERNAME:$REPO_PASSWORD@pkg.stoplight.io/rpm
enabled=1
gpgcheck=1
repo_gpgcheck=1
gpgkey=https://pkg.stoplight.io/stoplight.key
EOF
```

> Be sure to set your repository credentials before issuing the `cat` command

#### Installing the App Package

Once the repository is configured properly, you can install the app component using the command:

```bash
sudo yum install stoplight-app -y
```

### Docker Installation

To install the app component with Docker, run the command below:

```bash
docker pull quay.io/stoplight/app
```

> Note, if you have not already authenticated with the Stoplight container registry, you will be prompted for credentials

## Configuring and Running

To configure the Stoplight app component, you will need to provide connection details to the other necessary Stoplight components.

### Package-based Installations

#### Configuring the Service

The Stoplight app configuration is located at the location:

```bash
/etc/stoplight-app/stoplight-app.cfg
```

The above file should contain the following entries:

```bash
# SL_APP_HOST is the public-facing URL for the stoplight application
SL_APP_HOST="https://stoplight.example.com"

# SL_API_HOST is the URL to the Stoplight API
SL_API_HOST="https://stoplight-api.internal.example.com:3030"

# SL_GITLAB_HOST is the full URL to the Stoplight Gitlab instance
SL_GITLAB_HOST="https://gitlab.internal.example.com:8080"

# SL_EXPORTER_HOST is the full URL to the Stoplight Gitlab instance
SL_EXPORTER_HOST="https://stoplight-exporter.internal.example.com"

# SL_PRISM_HOST is the full URL to the Stoplight Prism instance
SL_PRISM_HOST="https://stoplight-prism.internal.example.com"

# SL_PUBS_HOST is the top-level domain used for documentation
SL_PUBS_HOST="docs.example.com"

# SL_PUBS_INGRESS is the URL to the Stoplight Pubs instance admin API
SL_PUBS_INGRESS="https://pubs.example.com:9098"
```

Be sure to customize any variable above as needed.

#### Starting the Service

To start the app server, run the command:

```bash
sudo systemctl start stoplight-app
```

Once started, you can see the status of the service using the command:

```bash
sudo systemctl status stoplight-app
```

### Docker Installations

#### Configuring the Container

The Stoplight app container requires the following environment variables be exposed to the running instance:

```bash
# SL_APP_HOST is the public-facing URL for the stoplight application
SL_APP_HOST="https://stoplight.example.com"

# SL_API_HOST is the URL to the Stoplight API
SL_API_HOST="https://stoplight-api.internal.example.com:3030"

# SL_GITLAB_HOST is the full URL to the Stoplight Gitlab instance
SL_GITLAB_HOST="https://gitlab.internal.example.com:8080"

# SL_EXPORTER_HOST is the full URL to the Stoplight Gitlab instance
SL_EXPORTER_HOST="https://stoplight-exporter.internal.example.com"

# SL_PRISM_HOST is the full URL to the Stoplight Prism instance
SL_PRISM_HOST="https://stoplight-prism.internal.example.com"

# SL_PUBS_HOST is the top-level domain used for documentation
SL_PUBS_HOST="docs.example.com"

# SL_PUBS_INGRESS is the URL to the Stoplight Pubs instance admin API
SL_PUBS_INGRESS="https://pubs.example.com:9098"
```

To expose these to the Docker runtime, either write them to a file and use the `--env-file` argument:

```bash
cat <<EOF>app-env-vars
SL_APP_HOST="..."
...
EOF

docker run --env-file app-env-vars ...
```

Alternatively, you can expose them one at a time with the `-e` flag:

```bash
docker run -e SL_APP_HOST=https://stoplight.example.com ...
```

#### Starting the Container

To start the app container, run the command:

```bash
docker run \
    --restart on-failure \
		--env-file app-env \
		-p 1234:3100 \
		quay.io/stoplight/app:latest
```

If started properly, the container should be marked with a healthy status after 30 seconds. Use the `docker ps` command to verify the container was started and is running properly.

## Post-install Validations

Once the app component is running, you can verify the installation was successful by visiting the app hostname and port in a web browser. If the web page loads properly (what you see when visiting the [hosted site](https://next.stoplight.io/login)), then you should be greeted with a login screen, complete with images and styling.

If you would like to verify the app installation from the CLI, use `wget` to search for any broken links:

```
wget -r -l2 â€“spider -D example.com http://example.com 2>&1 | grep -B1 'broken link!'
```

> Be sure to replace 'example.com' above with the domain used to install the Stoplight application

No broken links reflects that the app was setup successfully.
